Spectral Clustering


This repo is mostly sMatlab projects related to Spectral methods
of clustering and semi-supervisied lablel propagation.  
There is lots of prototype code here.


Spectral embedding with eigenfunctions  
SpectralEmbeddingEigenFunctions : spectralembedding.m,

EigenCuts 
EigenCuts :  cutDemo.m

Eigenfunction method for computing approximate eigenvectors of graph Laplacian 
SemiSupervisedSpectralEigenFunctionApprox : demo_vmb.m

(Shi and Malik, 2000) goes into the some of the background behind EigenCuts
